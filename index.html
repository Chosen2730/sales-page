          You don't know me and I don't know you but what you and I both know is

              Maybe you already know this, maybe you’ve been trying to become
              profitable for ages but for some reason you haven't been able to
              get it right, and you haven't been able to stay consistently
              profitable as a cryptocurrency trader.

                I’ll study the markets harder and get profitable in no time

                It's all a lie nobody makes money from trading these markets

              Maybe you've even told yourself that trading isn't your thing
              because you've incurred so many losses.

              Look, I don't know what success looks like for you in the future.
              However, I'm confident that taking losses and losing money isn't
              part of your plans when you started trading.
